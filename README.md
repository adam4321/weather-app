# weather-app

Local weather application that is built in valilla JavaScript and uses the Open Weather API to return the current weather. If geolocation is successful for the user's location, then the application doesn't ask the user for their location. If geolocation is unsuccessful, or if the user manually decides to change the location then a form is rendered so that the user can manually enter their location.
