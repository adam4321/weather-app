## Weather Widget

A Local weather application that is built using plain JavaScript, Html, and Css. It uses the Open Weather API to return the current weather for either the current location of the user or a manually selected city. If geolocation is successful for the user's location, then the application doesn't ask the user for their location. If geolocation is unsuccessful, or if the user manually decides to change the location then a form is rendered so that the user can manually choose the city.
